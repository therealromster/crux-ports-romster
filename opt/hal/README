README for hal 0.5.7.1

REQUIREMENTS

PRE/POST-INSTALL
	Create a user/group haldaemon with a unused id < 99:

	'groupadd -g 82 haldaemon'
	'useradd -u 82 -g haldaemon -d /var/empty -s /bin/false haldaemon'
	'passwd -l haldaemon'

	If you wish to take advantage of the hotplug and automount-style features
	that apps like gnome-mount, gnome-volume-manager, or the like offer, create
	a 'plugdev' group and add your user to it, or change the 'plugdev' group in
	/usr/etc/dbus-1/system.d/hal.conf to something else and make sure your user
	is a member of that group.

PRECAUTION
