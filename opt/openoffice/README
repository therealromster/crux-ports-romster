OPENOFFICE.ORG CRUX PORT NOTES

1. OpenOffice 2.x does not correctly work on with the
   default CRUX NFS ports. If you need to open files
   on a NFS share, disable OpenOffice locking in 
   /usr/bin/soffice at the beginning of the file.
   You should end up with something like:

     STAR_PROFILE_LOCKING_DISABLED=1
     export STAR_PROFILE_LOCKING_DISABLED
     
     # SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING=1
     # export SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING

2. The apps can be launched with "soffice -app",
   i.e "soffice -writer", "soffice -calc", etc. 
   Use spadmin to configure printers.

3. This is a quick port, ie no bloat removed.
   I hope I'll find some time to provide a better
   port in the near future. 
   For now, it's here for your convenience.

4. This is the binary release of OpenOffice.org.
   I'm afraid a source build could take days to complete.

5. In order to make the app use gtk widgets, put this
   line in your ~/.xinitrc file (or other appropriate places):

   xprop -root -format GNOME_SM_PROXY 8i -set GNOME_SM_PROXY 1
