REQUIREMENTS:

*** This must be built as 'root'.

PRECAUTION:

!!! WARNING !!! -

Please be carefull with the configuration of this software.
I have just discovered (and it was mentioned many times in the
author's documents) that misconfiguring this software can
really screw up your system.

You have been warned!

PRE-INSTALL:

Please remove libtrash-latest.tar.gz from your sources.
Since the author of this software doesn't name his archives
properly, pkgmk will think you already have the latest source
and the latest build will not work.

POST-INSTALL:

libtrash needs to be activated in order for it to take over the libc functions which are responsible for removing files... There are two ways of doing this. Always-On (System-Wide) or Manual (Per-User).

Either set your environment up as follows:

export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtrash.so

Or append this to your /etc/profile

This method works flawlessly and causes no problems.
The other method (please consult the README file in the source archive) is risky and _can_ cause problems if configured incorrectly.

PRE-REMOVE:

POST-REMOVE:

NOTES:

I will later provide an appropiate config file and rc to implement the first method for CRUX systems, but for now the above method, using an environment variable works fine :)
