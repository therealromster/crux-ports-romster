REQUIREMENTS:

	1. Kernel with "BSD Process Accounting" enabled.
	Note: Do _NOT_ Enable the new format. This is not supported
			by the current version of the GNU Accounting Utilities.

PRECAUTION:

PRE-INSTALL:

	In order for this to work you need to:
	a. Enable "BSD Process Accounting" in your kernel

POST-INSTALL:

	1. Make the directory /var/account/
	2. Touch the file /var/account/pacct
	3. Run: accton /var/account/pacct

	Just run the post-install script or --install-scripts

PRE-REMOVE:

POST-REMOVE:

NOTES:

	1. This somehow conflicts with base/sysvinit's last binary
		which I think accomplishses the same thing anyway.
		So I have deliberately removed it from the port.
	2. I don't think this is _meant_ to replace sysvinit at all :)
