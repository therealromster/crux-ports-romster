REQUIREMENTS:

PRECAUTION:

PRE-INSTALL:

POST-INSTALL:

Edit /etc/denyhosts/denyhosts.conf as needed.

Edit /etc/inetd.conf, I added:

#<service_name> <sock_type> <proto> <flags> <user> <server_path> <args>
sshd		stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/sbin/sshd in.sshd

Add inetd and denyhosts to services array on /etc/rc.conf, after net and before sshd is loaded (and any other services used by denyhost and inetd (not sure if this is necessary but i believe its good to allow protection before the services start).

PRE-REMOVE:

POST-REMOVE:

NOTES:

To protect sshd.

Edit /etc/hosts.allow and comment out everyting, everything will have access by default.

Edit /etc/hosts.deny and comment out the "ALL: ALL: DENY" part, also the "#End of file" bit will be useless as denyhosts appends to the file.

(note the config in inetd.conf dosn't seem to be right or needed? see messages apon boot up, any corections email me :) )
