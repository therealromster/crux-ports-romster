README for nvidia legacy 1.0-7184-1


**** NOTE for nvidia with udev ****

If using udev, add your user to the "video" group to be able to
use the nvidia devices required for 3d to function properly.


POST-INSTALL

Use contrib/gl-select-x11r7 from ports to select the correct gl/glx
libraries and extensions like so:

	# gl-select nvidia


POST-REMOVE

Use contrib/gl-select-x11r7 from ports to revert to the x11r7 gl/glx
libraries and extensions like so:

	# gl-select xorg


When UPGRADING/DOWNGRADING the nvidia port (where the version changes),
use gl-select to revert to xorg and then re-select nvidia in order to
refresh the libGLcore and libGL symlinks, like so:

	# prt-get update nvidia-x11r7-legacy
	# gl-select xorg; gl-select nvidia
