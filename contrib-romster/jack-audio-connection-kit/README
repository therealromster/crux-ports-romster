Jack - Audio Connection Kit

NOTES

Jack is a versatile, high-performance sound server.  It is geared
towards music professionals, and offers excellent low-latency 
operation when properly configured.

Jack works best with, but does not require, a low-latency patched 
kernel.  To obtain a patch for your kernel, see:

If you are using a patched kernel and wish to run jackd as a
non-priviliged user, consider launching the jack daemon with:

  schedtool -I -e jackd [options]

This will allow jackd to run in near real-time, to provide 
minimum latency, without starving other processes.
