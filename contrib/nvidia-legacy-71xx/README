REQUIREMENTS:

Add your users to the "video" group to be able to use the nvidia
devices required for 3d to function properly.

PRECAUTION:

PRE-INSTALL:

POST-INSTALL

Use opt/gl-select from ports to select the correct gl/glx libraries 
and extensions like so:

   # gl-select nvidia

PRE-REMOVE:

POST-REMOVE

Use opt/gl-select from ports to revert to the xorg gl/glx
libraries and extensions like so:

   # gl-select xorg


When UPGRADING/DOWNGRADING the nvidia port (where the version changes),
use gl-select to revert to xorg and then re-select nvidia in order to
refresh the libGLcore and libGL symlinks, like so:

   # prt-get update nvidia-legacy-71xx
   # gl-select xorg
   # gl-select nvidia

NOTES:

The following GPUs are no longer supported in the regular NVIDIA
Unified UNIX Graphics Driver. Instead, these GPUs will continue to be
supported through special "Legacy GPU" drivers that will be updated 
periodically to add support for new versions of Linux system 
components (e.g., new Linux kernels, new versions of the X server, 
etc).

There are presently two Legacy GPU driver series. The 1.0-71xx series
supports TNT, TNT2, GeForce 256, and GeForce2 GPUs. The 1.0-96xx 
series supports GeForce2 MX, GeForce3, GeForce4, and Quadro4 GPUs. 
For a complete list of the GPUs supported in each of the Legacy GPU 
driver series, see the lists below.

The 1.0-71xx driver supports the following set of GPUs:
