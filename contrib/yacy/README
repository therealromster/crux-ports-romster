REQUIREMENTS:

PRECAUTION:

	Once running goto the main page http://localhost:8080/ and set a password and
	maybe change the port too.

PRE-INSTALL:

	Yacy expects to have a user and group dedicated to it, a pre-install 
	script has been added to the port which takes care of this.

POST-INSTALL:

	Edit your favourite web browser and point it to proxy localhost 8080 or which 
	ip on your lan and port you have assigned.

PRE-REMOVE:

POST-REMOVE:

NOTES:

	Please add "yacy" to the SERVICES array in /etc/rc.conf if you'd like to run 
	yacy as a service (highly recomended).

	Apon startup yacy takes some time to load before the web browser will work, 
	and some time to shutdown too to save its state.
