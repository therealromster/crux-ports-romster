REQUIREMENTS:

PRECAUTION:

	Remove this port before upgrading the kernel then do a force rebuild then 
	install, after you have rebooted into the new kernel.

PRE-INSTALL:

	USB and Video4Linux must be in the kernel, and modprobed if built as modules, 
	also the kernel source must be present in:
	"/usr/src/linux-VERSION" VERSION being what "uname -r" returns.

POST-INSTALL:

	Add "/sbin/modprobe quickcam" to /etc/rc.modules

PRE-REMOVE:

POST-REMOVE:

NOTES:

I find setting MODPROBE=/sbin/modprobe easier, then use:

$MODPROBE quickcam
