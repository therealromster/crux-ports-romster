PREINSTALL:
Get a version of httpup greater then 0.4.0.
Filetype masking sucks without it, and you'll end up filling up your webspace
without trying.


POSTINSTALL:
You need to modify /usr/bin/htup to point to your repository.
Then, you need to configure weex.  dot_weexrc.example is provided as a template
Copy it to $HOME/.weexrc, then edit.  Copy dot_httpup-repgen-ignore, to either
$REPO/.httpup-repgen-ignore, or else ~/dot_httpup-repgen-ignore
Double check your configuration of /usr/bin/htup, and you will be ready to sync
