ChangeLog:

0.1
        - initial, monolithic kludge
        - it works, but is error-prone, inflexible, and ugly

0.2
        - decided to share script with others
        - added configurable variables
        - not good enough...rewrite!

0.3
        - htup no longer works.  Functionality disabled until re-write complete
        - broke main() into separate functions
        - added checks to prevent active work dir from being accidentally
	    deleted

0.4
        - cleaned out debug-related echos & TODOs
        - wrote README, and added dot_weexrc.example
        - first publicly available/usable release

0.5
        - rm index.html, before generating REPO
        - changed description.  Misc cosmetic fixes
        - fixed crash with multiple work dirs in $HTPORTS/*
        - ignore tarballs and packages#
        - check for Pkgfile's before httpup-repgen
        - added optional footer support, for sake of completeness
        - cleaned up contributed files
        - beta-grade functionality

0.5.1
        - code is stable enough, that 0.0.x can be used instead of 0.x
	    in the future, features will bump 0.0.x.  Bugfix's will
	    usually be denoted by incrementing $release.  When a
	    major TODO is completed, I'll increment 0.x.
        - htup is going to be 0.5.x for a while
        - fixed redundant '/' between portdir//portname
        - add "usage:" output
        - began supporting thorough port checks
        - new dependency: wget
        - checks entire repository for bad sources
        - minor streamlining, to prevent redundancy
        - htup now outputs basic, helpful statistics
        - changed description again

0.5.2
        - misc style/efficiency fixes
        - nice, informative output during surveil() "htup --check"
        - .footprint check
        - .footprint fix? (yes/no)
        - Pkgfile sanity checking
        - htup is definitely BETA now
        - trap INT cleanly, during "htup --check", output stats, cleanup
        - after surveil() completes, ask if user wishes to rm junk,
	    and fix broken .footprints
        - more helpful stats
R2	- fixed reporting wrong # of ports, if work dir is found
        - oops!  I didn't realize that my public branch of htup needed sudo
R3	- fixed addition of backup~ files to REPO, then not uploading them
        - found a dangling cd $HTPORTS.  Now one can sync from any dir without
	    interruption
        - thanks Johannes!  httpup-repgen changes solve R3 "fix" #1 for real

0.5.2.1
	- released due to httpup-repgen 0.6pre1 internal changes
R2	- fixed a regression caused by calling portspage from external dir
R3	- fixed broken handling of .footprints in surveil()
R4	- fixed broken sanity checks for active work dir
R5	- fixed broken and redundant pkgmk check...R4 didn't fix!
	- added useful output after fail on [ -d $HTPORTS/*/work ]
R6	- use httpup-repgen2, because it is now shipped standard
	  (previously, a manual download was required)
R7	- httpup 4.0 was just released.  Undo R6 changes.
R8	- use sudo to remove work directories too
R9	- changed indents to spaces, and let emacs auto-indent
	- aesthetic, and grammatical fixes ;-)
