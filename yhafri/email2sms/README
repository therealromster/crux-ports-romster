                * Copy the sample config file sample.email2smsrc to
                 ~/.email2smsrc (or to somewhere else if you want).

                * Edit the config file (it's fully commented and should 
                all be very obvious).

                * Put something like this in a sensible place in your
                 ~/.procmailrc:

                 :0 c
                 | email2sms | send_SMS

                 where send_SMS is a program which sends anything it
                 receives on STDIN to your phone.  


NOTE:
                 * See sample.send_SMS for an example script
                 which sends a message via a typical WWW -> SMS gateway.
