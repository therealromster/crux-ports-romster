FireMake HOWTO
==============

FireMake is a shell script designed to be packaged with a piece of
software and run on each computer building that software.  It creates
a Makefile based on the architecture it is run on, the build
environment, the modules it is configured with, and the files in the
directory that it is run from.

--------------------------------
Converting a package to FireMake
--------------------------------

1) Remove any existing build system including configure scripts and
   Makefiles

2) Copy the 'configure' script from the FireMake distribution into
   the project directory

3) Copy the 'modules' directory and all files in it from the FireMake
   distribution into the project directory

4) Rename the 'modules' directory to 'firemake'

5) Remove any items from the modules directory that you don't need
   (see modules reference below when in doubt)

6) Configure remaining modules (see module reference below)

7) Edit program source files to #include "firemake.h" and not to
   include headers for any of the automatically configured programs.

8) Run ./configure && make and try it out!



----------------
Module Reference
----------------

Module name: alsa
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libasound and appropriate headers
  from the ALSA package, and that programs can be compiled using these.
  Adds the appropriate header includes to firemake.h and alters the
  LDFLAGS to link in the library from the right location.  Aborts the
  configure process if the library is not found.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: binaries
Requires: strip, makefiletop, prefix
Recommends: install, dependencies
Configuration files: firemake.binaries, firemake.sbinaries, firemake.noinstall
Description: Creates rules to build and install binary files.  Entries
  in firemake.binaries and firemake.sbinaries should be of the form:

     binaryoutputfile: object1.o object2.o

  object1.c and object2.c should exist in the project directory; .o files
  will be built automatically.  If the binary should not be installed
  (testing programs, etc.), it's name should go on a line of
  firemake.noinstall (one name per line) and an install rule will not be
  created.

  This module will also trigger the dependency functions if the dependencies
  module is available, causing customized build rules to be created for each
  .o file.  Without this module present, each .o file is assumed to depend
  only on its corresponding .c file, which is usually incorrect but only
  matters for developers.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: bzip2
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libbz2 and appropriate headers,
  and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the appropriate
  header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to link in the
  library from the right location.  Aborts the configure process if the
  library is not found.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: c99
Requires: cc, cflags
Description: Checks the gcc version to determine if C99 is sufficient
  for use of the 'restrict' and 'inline' keywords.  If so, adds -std=c99
  to the CFLAGS.  If not, adds lines to firemake.h to make these keywords
  be removed from the source by the preprocessor.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: cc
Description: Checks for a C compiler.  Aborts if unable to find 'gcc' or
  'cc'.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: cflags
Requires: cc
Output files: compiletest.log
Environment variables: CFLAGS
Description: Attempts to find a CFLAGS variable in the environment.  If it
  fails, creates default CFLAGS based on the compiler name.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: compiletest
Requires: cc, cflags
Description: Provides internal routines to help other modules with testing
  of various programs and compile options.  Writes all tests and results
  to 'compiletest.log'.  Writes a rule to remove compiletest.log on
  'make distclean'.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: conf
Requires: makefiletop, prefix
Description: Checks for configuration files in a 'conf' subdirectory of the
  project directory.  Adds rules to install these files in the correct
  location if there are not already copies present.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: context
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Checks for system support for setcontext(), getcontext(),
  makecontext() and swapcontext().  If found working, respectively defines
  HAVE_SETCONTEXT, HAVE_GETCONTEXT, HAVE_MAKECONTEXT and HAVE_SWAPCONTEXT
  in the preprocessor environment.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: crypt
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Checks for system support for the "crypt" library, needed
  to be able to call crypt(3) on some systems.  If found, adds "-lcrypt"
  to CFLAGS.  

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: curses
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libncurses or libcurses and
  appropriate headers, and that programs can be compiled using these.
  Adds the appropriate header includes to firemake.h and alters the
  LDFLAGS to link in the library from the right location.  Aborts the
  configure process if the library is not found.

-------------------------------------------------------
Module name: dependencies
Requires: cc, cflags
Description: Provides helper functions to other modules to generate
  customized build rules for each object file.  Without this module,
  FireMake assumes that each object file depends only on it's
  corresponding .c file.  This is good enough to get these files
  built, but will not rebuild them if an included header file changes.
  This module uses the C compiler to generate a full dependency list
  for each object file, so it can correctly rebuild files when changes
  are made.  While this is the right behaviour, it only slows down the
  built process and probably isn't necessary for most software
  consumers.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: epoll
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the availability of the epoll() functions in the
  system C library AND for kernel support.  If found, defines the
  preprocessor symbol HAVE_EPOLL in the CFLAGS.  If not found,
  continues without.  The epoll(4) family of functions were introduced
  into the Linux 2.6 kernel series as scalable replacement for select(2)
  and poll(2).

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: expat
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libexpat and appropriate headers,
  and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the appropriate
  header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to link in the
  library from the right location.  Aborts the configure process if the
  library is not found.

Requires: compiletest, cflags, firestring, pthread
Recommends: subdir
Description: Tests for the presence of libfiredns and appropriate headers,
  and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the appropriate
  header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to link in the
  library from the right location.  Aborts the configure process if the
  library is not found.  Can accept a local copy of the library in a
  subdirectory called 'firedns'; will compile and link the library in
  statically.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: firemime
Requires: compiletest, cflags, firestring
Recommends: subdir
Description: Tests for the presence of libfiremime and appropriate headers,
  and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the appropriate
  header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to link in the
  library from the right location.  Aborts the configure process if the
  library is not found.  Can accept a local copy of the library in a
  subdirectory called 'firemime'; will compile and link the library in
  statically.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: firerpc
Requires: compiletest, cflags, firestring, firedns
Recommends: subdir
Description: Tests for the presence of libfirerpc and appropriate headers,
  and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the appropriate
  header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to link in the
  library from the right location.  Aborts the configure process if the
  library is not found.  Can accept a local copy of the library in a
  subdirectory called 'firerpc'; will compile and link the library in
  statically.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: firestring
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Recommends: subdir
Description: Tests for the presence of libfirestring and appropriate headers,
  and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the appropriate
  header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to link in the
  library from the right location.  Aborts the configure process if the
  library is not found.  Can accept a local copy of the library in a
  subdirectory called 'firestring'; will compile and link the library in
  statically.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: freetype2
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libfreetype (version 2) and
  appropriate headers, and that programs can be compiled using these.
  Adds the appropriate header includes to firemake.h and alters the
  LDFLAGS to link in the library from the right location.  Aborts the
  configure process if the library is not found.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: gcvt
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the availability of the gcvt() function in the
  system C library.  If found, defines the preprocessor symbol
  HAVE_GCVT in the CFLAGS.  If not found, continues without.
  (The gcvt() function doesn't seem to come from any UNIX standard
  whatsover; it's absense should not prevent an entire program from
  building).

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: gd
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libgd and appropriate headers,
  and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the appropriate
  header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to link in the

Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of the Gnome 2.0 user interface
  libraries.  If found, adds the appropriate CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
  Aborts the configure process if not found.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: headers
Requires: makefiletop, prefix
Configuration files: firemake.headers
Description: Reads header file names, one per line, from
  'firemake.headers'.  Writes makefile rules to install these
  headers to the appropriate directory.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: id
Description: Checks for the 'id' program.  This is needed by
  the install module to determine the installation user and
  group.

-------------------------------------------------------

  the library is not found.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: libraries
Requires: prefix, compiletest, cflags, version
Recommends: dependencies
Configuration files: firemake.libraries
Description: Creates makefile entries to build and install libraries
  listed in 'firemake.libraries'.  Entries in that file should appear
  as:

  libraryname: object1.o object2.o

  object1.c and object2.c should exist in the project directory.  The
  .o files will be created automatically.  Both libraryname.a and
  libraryname.so.VERSION will be created.  Both will be installed, and
  symlinks to more generic version numbers will be created in the
  install directory.

  This module is also in charge of decting proper flags needed to
  build a shared library on each platform.

  This module will also trigger the dependency functions if the dependencies
  module is available, causing customized build rules to be created for each
  .o file.  Without this module present, each .o file is assumed to depend
  only on its corresponding .c file, which is usually incorrect but only
  matters for developers.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: make
Description: Checks for capabilities of the system 'make' program.
  Other modules may need this information to write Makefiles
  correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: makefiletop
Requires: prefix, make
Description: Writes out the top of the makefile, including the rules
  to make .o files from .c files and to handle 'make all', 'make clean'
  and 'make distclean' by distributing these rules down to modules.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: man
Requires: makefiletop, prefix
Description: Checks for man pages in a 'man' subdirectory of the
  project directory.  Adds rules to install these manpages in the
  correct location.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: math
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libm and appropriate headers,

  library from the right location.  Aborts the configure process if
  the library is not found.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: prefix
Requires: cflags
Environment variables: PREFIX, BINDIR, SBINDIR, MANDIR, CONFDIR, LIBDIR, INCLUDEDIR
Description: Attempts to get PREFIX from the environment.  Failing that
  sets PREFIX to /usr/local.  Adds BINDIR, SBINDIR, MANDIR, CONFDIR,
  LIBDIR and INCLUDEDIR as preprocessor variables using CFLAGS so
  programs can know where to find other program files.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: pthread
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Attempts to discover the correct compile flags to build
  programs that use POSIX threads on the system.  Adds appropriate
  flags and header includes, or aborts if no method succeeds.  This
  module sometimes detects -pthread as being the correct method on
  platforms where it produces a compile warning; this should not stop
  the build from working properly.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: sigaction
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Checks for system support for sigaction(). If found
  working, defines HAVE_SIGACTION in the preprocessor environment.

-------------------------------------------------------

Description: Checks for system support for sigaltstack(). If found
  working, defines HAVE_SIGALTSTACK in the preprocessor environment.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: strip
Description: Checks for the 'strip' program.  If found, the binaries
  module will use it to remove debugging symbols from installed
  programs for faster execution.  If not found, this step is skipped.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: socket
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Checks for system support for the "socket" library.  If
  found, adds "-lsocket -lnsl" to LDFLAGS.  This is required on some
  on operating systems (Solaris) for network software to compile.
  Adds socket headers includes whether the library is required or not.  

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: subdir
Requires: cc, cflags
Description: Provides a helper function that allows some other modules
  to detect local copies of libraries and allows make targets 'all',
  'distclean' and 'clean' to be passed down into the subdirectories.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: version
Requires: cflags
Configuration files: firemake.version
Description: Helper module which loads 'firemake.version' from the
  main project directory.  If not present, sets the version to 
  '0.0.0'.  Adds the preprocessor macro VERSION so the program
  can display version information from the same source.

-------------------------------------------------------

Module name: zlib
Requires: compiletest, cflags
Description: Tests for the presence of libz and appropriate
  headers, and that programs can be compiled using these.  Adds the
  appropriate header includes to firemake.h and alters the LDFLAGS to
  link in the library from the right location.  Aborts the configure
