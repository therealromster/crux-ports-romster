POST-INSTALL:

		* Load FUSE kernel module as root:
		# modprobe fuse 

		* You can mount your Gmail filesystem either
		via fstab or on the command line using mount.

		To use fstab, create an entry /etc/fstab that
		looks something like:

		/usr/bin/gmailfs.py /path/of/mount/point gmailfs noauto,username=gmailuser,password=gmailpass,fsname=zOlRRa

		The username and password fields speak for themselves.
		The fsname is the name of this Gmail filesystem. 
		It is important to choose a hard-to-guess name here,
		because if others can guess the fsname, they can corrupt 
		your Gmail filesystem by injecting spurious messages
		into your Inbox.

		To mount from the command line, do:

		mount -t gmailfs /usr/bin/gmailfs.py /path/of/mount/point -o username=gmailuser,password=gmailpass,fsname=zOlRRa
