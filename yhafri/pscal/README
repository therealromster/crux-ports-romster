OPTIONS:
        The shell variables BANNER, LFOOT, CFOOT, and RFOOT become a
        top centered banner, and left, centered, or right justified
        footers respectively.  As in:

                BANNER="Schedule 1"; CFOOT=Preliminary; pscal 4 1990

FILES:
        The file $HOME/.holiday is read and used to print short messages
        on specified days.  The .holiday file should consist of lines of
        the form
                month:day:message string
        Messages should be 20 characters or less, with no more than 6
        messages per day.  No spaces should appear from the beginning
        of a line until after the second colon.
        Month and day should be numbers in the obvious ranges.
        12/89 - The holiday checking has been loosened up in that the
        following takes place:
                1. The Shell Variable EFILE is used preferentially
                2. Then the file Events in the current directory is used
                3. Finally the $HOME/.holiday file is used.
        The whole process can be turned off by setting EFILE=/dev/null.
