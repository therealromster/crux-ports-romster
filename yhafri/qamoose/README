POST-INSTALL:

+ Modify dict_header.pl
   - Inspect and modify file with YOUR info (username/password/domain, etc)
   - Insure $embed's value is 0 (unless you're embedding this code into
     your site and would like to extend the look-n-feel of the package
     NOTE: setting this to 1 will require some customization work on your
     end as well on dict_main, dict_admin and dict_lib)

+ Insure availability of mySQL on your local machine - if a different
  database is used, make appropriate modification in dict_header.pl

+ Run `dict_create.pl'

+ Invoke (click-on) dict_admin.cgi within your browser

+ Login by entering your Super admin email and password

+ Click on 'Account:Password' to change Super admin's password
  NOTE: Once Password is changed the entry in dict_lib.pl is irrelevant.
  NOTE: All passwords are stored in the mySQL db in encrypted form.

+ Logout and now the package is ready for usage

+ Invoke (click-on) dict_main.cgi within your browser - MAIN start point
