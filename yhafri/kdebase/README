Since KDE has way too many compilation requirements, I would like to
inform you about the PKGMK_IGNORE_FOOTPRINT variable in
/etc/pkgmk.conf.  You'll probably get a bunch of .footprint mismatches
during compilation if your system differs from my build host.

Automated builds will (hopefully ;-) not fail if you set
PKGMK_IGNORE_FOOTPRINT="yes".

NOTE: If your system has less then 512Mb of VM, you may need to
"sed -i 's/make$/make no-final/' /usr/ports/opt/kde*/Pkgfile".
Alternatively, you can edit each of /usr/ports/opt/kde*/Pkgfile, and
remove the line which says "--enable-final"; don't forget to remove
the trailing "\" from the line before.  Personally, I feel that using
sed to do the work of such tedious editing is a better use of busy
users' time. :-)

this order:

      superfluous
    * gamin is included in opt to provide libfam.so, to save you from
      rebuilding all of you KDE applications, if you're upgrading
    * I don't use Gamin anymore (direct inotify seems faster & more stable)
