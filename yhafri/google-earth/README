PRE-INSTALL:

Your graphic card need to be correctly installed


INFO:

Google Earth version 4.0.2414
Tue Oct 31 16:06:51 PST 2006
Installation size: 55M


Known issues and important information. Please read this first if you
 are having problems with Google Earth!


LOCALIZATION:

 As you might have noticed, this README is only available in English for
 the first release. Our apologies. The rest of Google Earth and the
 installer should be available in at least English, French, Italian,
 German, and Spanish.


IF YOUR HOME DIRECTORY IS ON NFS:

 Google Earth writes files only to $HOME/.googleearth ... if this directory
 is on network storage, consider making a symlink from there to somewhere
 on your local disk. Google Earth's file cache can take an enormous amount
 of bandwidth if i/o is sent over a network, which drains your resources and
 slows down the application.


UPGRADING:

 Google Earth's installer will automatically reinstall/upgrade when a user
  runs the installer a second time. All you need to do is download a newer
  version and run its installer to upgrade.


UNINSTALLING:

 Run the "uninstall" script as the user that installed the program, which
  will be in the directory where you installed previously. Alternately,
  delete the installed copy and also $HOME/.loki/installed/googleearth.xml

 During operation, Google Earth writes files only to $HOME/.googleearth ...
  when uninstalling, you can delete this directory at your discretion, but
  you will lose your preferences, placemarks, and download cache.


BROWSER AND EMAIL INTEGRATION:

 Please read linux/README-mailto.txt in the installation directory
  if you want Google Earth to launch a web browser and email
  composition window correctly.


GLIBC ISSUES:

 If you crash on startup, you may have an outdated version of glibc, or a bad
  interaction between Nvidia's drivers and glibc's pthread support. Many of
  these cases can be resolved by exporting this environment variable before
  running Google Earth.

    LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.10

 Alternately, consider upgrading your video drivers, which has been known to
  fix this situation, too. We have also seen one case of the Nvidia drivers
  mistaking the type of glibc installed, which was remedied with
  LD_ASSUME_KERNEL, but in this case, a driver upgrade might be a better
  solution. Installing the Nvidia drivers with the --force-tls=new option
  may be a solution, but please don't do this unless you are sure of what
  you are doing.

 Similar rules may apply to ATI's drivers.

 Please refer to your GNU/Linux distribution vendor to find out the best way
  to upgrade the video drivers on your system.


DESKTOP INTEGRATION:

 Some systems may require the user to log out and restart before Google Earth
  will appear in their Applications/Internet menu. Some may also explicitly
  need the user to tell the file manager to open a .kml file in Google Earth
  before it will make the connection, fixing other apps like Firefox all at
  once. We are still researching why this happens to some users and not others.

 Desktops that don't follow the freedesktop.org standards will not
  install an icon in the Applications menu. This will happen on older
  distributions. In these cases, the user may be able to install icons and
  associations manually. Refer to your GNU/Linux distribution vendor for
  details on how to customize your desktop.


SOFTWARE MESA:

 Google Earth can be run with "Mesa" (all software-rendered OpenGL), but the
  experience is sub-optimal. If you have 3D-accelerated video hardware, please
  install its drivers. Many distributions do not correctly install 3D drivers
  for even popular, mainstream hardware. If this is the first 3D application
  you've tried and it's very slow, it's likely that you don't have drivers
  installed at all. Please refer to your GNU/Linux distribution vendor for
  information on getting your video card drivers correctly installed.


PRINTING:

 Google Earth prints via Qt's interfaces, and should work if you have CUPS
  installed and correctly configured.


PROXIES:

 Google Earth uses libCurl for HTTP/HTTPS access to the network, and as such,
  will respect the same proxy settings that curl uses:

      http_proxy [protocol://]<host>[:port]

 If you have a squid proxy at 192.168.1.2, you might use something like this:

      export http_proxy http://192.168.1.2:3128

 Google Earth prompts you for the proxy password if it requires authorization.


BUG REPORTS:

 In the hopefully-unlikely event that Google Earth crashes, it will send the
  bug report back to Google automatically next time you run the program. There
  is NO personal information in the crash report (just where the program died,
  how long it had been running, and some other things like that). If you would
  rather these never be sent back, make sure read and write permission is
  removed from your ~/.googleearth/crashlogs directory.


DISCUSSION AND COMMUNITY:

 Come hang out with us at Google Earth Community! Other users, both on
  GNU/Linux and other platforms, come here to discuss all things
  Google Earth. It's a great resource for everything from unique planetary
  finds to world tours to Frequently Asked Questions to information on
  developing and sharing your own content inside Google Earth.

Enjoy!

       intellectual property protections inherent in the Original
       Code, SGI hereby grants Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free,
       non-exclusive license, to do the following: (i) under
       copyrights Licensable by SGI, to reproduce, distribute, create
       derivative works from, and, to the extent applicable, display
       and perform the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided
       by SGI alone and/or as part of a Larger Work; and (ii) under
       any Licensable Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer
       for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code
       and/or any Modifications provided by SGI. Recipient accepts the
       terms and conditions of this License by undertaking any of the
       aforementioned actions. The patent license shall apply to the
       Covered Code if, at the time any related Modification is added,
       such addition of the Modification causes such combination to be
       covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license in Section
       2.1(ii) shall not apply to any other combinations that include
       the Modification. No patent license is provided under SGI
       Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by Modifications not
       provided by SGI or combinations of Original Code and
       Modifications not provided by SGI.

  2.2. Recipient License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License
       and any third party intellectual property claims, Recipient

       royalty-free, non-exclusive license, under any Recipient
       Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import
       and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code and/or any
       Modifications provided by SGI.

  2.3. No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted
       in Section 2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in
       Hardware of the algorithms embodied in the Original Code or any
       Modifications provided by SGI .

  3. Redistributions. 

  3.1. Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in
       Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in
       any and all redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions
       of the Covered Code in source code form, the Notice must appear
       in every file that can include a text comments field; in
       executable form, the Notice and a copy of this License must
       appear in related documentation or collateral where the
       Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described. Any
       Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the
       Original Code must also be retained or included in any and all
       redistributions of Covered Code.

  3.2. Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance
       with the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as
       without derogation of any of SGI's rights in and to the
       Original Code, distribute the source code and/or executable
       version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License; (2) a
       license identical to this License but for only such changes as
       are necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as licensor
       of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's choosing,
       containing terms different from this License, provided that the
       license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10,
       12, and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by
       any other terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any
       license other than this License, Recipient must make it
       absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this
       License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI. It is
       emphasized that this License is a limited license, and,
       regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in
       accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only
       such rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it
       has actually been granted by SGI in this License.

  3.3. Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any
       liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative
       license terms Recipient offers.

  4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
     terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and
     fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense
     to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any
     termination of this License, absent termination by the terms of
     such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in
     effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.

  5. No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any
     rights to: (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor
     shall any other rights or licenses not expressly granted
     hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with
     respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark or
     service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related
     right for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products
     derived from the Covered Code, without prior written permission
     of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code,
     which shall at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the
     Original Code not expressly granted under this License are
     reserved. 

  6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various
     worldwide laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to
     dispositions of Covered Code, including without limitation
     export, re-export, and import control laws, regulations, and
     executive orders, of the U.S. government and other countries, and
     Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
     regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute
     Covered Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or
     contributorily) any intellectual property rights of any kind of
     any other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or
     warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which, under any
     applicable law, it might be deemed to have been subject.

  7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party
     claim that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality
     wholly or partially infringes the third party's intellectual
     property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such
     claim.

  8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the License from time to time, each with a
     distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been
     published under a particular version of the License, Recipient
     may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it under
     the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code
     under the terms of any subsequent version published by
     SGI. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this
     License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
     created under this License.

  9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL
     EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED,
     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND
     CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR
     A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SGI ASSUMES NO RISK
     AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD THE
     SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR
     LIABILITY FOR SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
     WARRANTY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
     COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT SUBJECT TO THIS
     DISCLAIMER.

  10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES NOR LEGAL
      THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE
      OR STRICT LIABILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY
      SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
      LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
      OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
      HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
      OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
      APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
      NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
      APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

  11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages
      arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
      rights under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and
      hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss,
      liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of
      reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
      modification, reproduction and distribution of the Covered Code
      or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

  12. U.S. Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial
      item" consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms
      are defined in title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and
      all U.S. Government End Users acquire only the rights set forth
      in this License and are subject to the terms of this License.

  13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
      concerning the its subject matter. If any provision of this
      License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
      reformed so as to achieve as nearly as possible the same legal
      and economic effect as the original provision and the remainder
      of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be
      governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
      United States and the State of California as applied to
      agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within
      California between California residents. Any litigation relating
      to this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
      of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California
      (or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in such courts, the
      courts of the State of California), with venue lying exclusively
      in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
      responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
      and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of
      the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
      Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation that
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
      against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

  The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or
  implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy,
  merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.  This software
  is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to
  its quality and accuracy.
  
  This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
  All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
  
  Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
  software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject
  to these conditions:

  (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
  then this README file must be included, with this copyright and
  no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or
  changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in
  accompanying documentation.

  (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
  documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the
  work of the Independent JPEG Group".

  (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user
  accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the
  authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
  
  These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the
  IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work,
  you ought to acknowledge us.
  
  Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or
  company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software
  or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only
  as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
  
  We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
  basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or
  liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
  
  
  ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of
  L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin
  Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.  ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the
  above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual
  distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
  that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the
  file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not
  needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does
  not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
  
  The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
  Autoconf.  It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is
  freely distributable.  The same holds for its supporting scripts
  (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support
  script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely
  distributable.
  
  It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is
  covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence
  arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or
  more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has
  been removed from the free JPEG software.  (Since arithmetic coding
  provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it
  is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)  So far
  as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
  code.
  
  The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF
  files.  To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF
  reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has
  been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does
  not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than
  usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
  
  We are required to state that
      "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
      CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
      CompuServe Incorporated."

  Parts of this software have been adapted from the libpng package.    
  Although this library supports all features from the PNG specification
  (as MNG descends from it) it does not require the libpng package.    
  It does require the zlib library and optionally the IJG jpeg library,
  and/or the "little-cms" library by Marti Maria (depending on the     
  inclusion of support for JNG and Full-Color-Management respectively. 

  This library's function is primarily to read and display MNG         
  animations. It is not meant as a full-featured image-editing         
  component! It does however offer creation and editing functionality  
  at the chunk level.

  third party intellectual property claims: 
  
  (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
  distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
  Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and 
  
  (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
  Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the Original
  Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such
  patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original

  necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 
  
  2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby grants You a
  world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third
  party intellectual property claims: 
  
  (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
  distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions
  thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
  Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and 
  
  (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
  Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
  thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably
  necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or
  portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be
  necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations. 
  
  3. Distribution Obligations. 
  
  3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to
  which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
  including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
  Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
  or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
  You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
  Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
  Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version
  of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
  include an additional document offering the additional rights
  described in Section 3.5. 
  
  3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create
  or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form
  under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
  Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
  and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
  remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
  initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
  subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
  available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
  the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
  Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
  
  3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to
  which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
  made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
  include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
  directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
  Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
  related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
  of the Covered Code. 
  
  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
  
  (a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
  intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
  its utilization under this License), you must include a text file
  with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the
  claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
  recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
  after You make Your Modification available as described in Section
  3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
  available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
  appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
  inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
  been obtained. 
  
  (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
  programming interface and You own or control patents which are
  reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
  this information in the LEGAL file. 
  
  3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
  each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation
  for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating
  to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may
  add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.
  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
  file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a
  location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be
  likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to
  charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
  any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
  offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
  Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
  
  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered
  Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5
  have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
  stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
  under the terms of this License, including a description of how and
  where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
  must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
  version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
  the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your
  choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
  that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that
  the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or
  alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
  rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
  version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
  that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
  alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby
  agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for
  any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
  as a result of any such terms You offer. 
  
  3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
  Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
  must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
  Covered Code. 
  
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
  
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
  statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
  this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
  limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
  included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
  included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
  extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
  understand it. 
  
  5. Application of this License. 
  
  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
  attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 
  
  6. Versions of the License. 
  
  6.1. New Versions. Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given
  a distinguishing version number. 
  
  6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published
  under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to
  use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
  such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
  License published by Floris van den Berg No one other than Floris van
  den Berg has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
  created under this License. 
  
  6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of
  this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code
  which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must
  (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "FreeImage", `FreeImage
  Public License", "FIPL", or any confusingly similar phrase do not
  appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that
  your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
  FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
  Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
  Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
  this License.) 
  
  7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
  
  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
  DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
  THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE
  IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
  CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
  EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 
  
  8. TERMINATION. 
  
  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
  sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
  survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
  nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
  shall survive. 
  
  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
  
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
  DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
  OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
  PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
  LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
  ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY
  SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
  PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
  APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
  ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
  
  10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
  
  The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
  48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
  software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
  terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
  C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
  1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
  those rights set forth herein. 
  
  11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
  Dutch law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
  provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
  respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or
  an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the The
  Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes
  relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to
  intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
  arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration;
  (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in
  Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation relating to this
  Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court of
  Almelo, The Netherlands with the losing party responsible for costs,
  including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
  fees and expenses. Any law or regulation which provides that the
  language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
  not apply to this License. 
  
  12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
  
  Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
  Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
  indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License,
  based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the
  revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant
  factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute
