PRE-INSTALL:
		* Unfortunately, you need to install Alien-wxWidgets manually before.
		# perl -MCPAN -eshell
		cpan>force install Alien::wxWidgets

		This is because it uses the very sillu, nasty Perl module ever seen, I say: Module::Build.
		This module don't give necessary interface to be installed automagically.
