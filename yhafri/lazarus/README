POST-INSTALL:

If you started lazarus in a terminal, you can see some
  notes about missing settings. This is normal at first start.
  The IDE automatically tries to find out where the freepascal compiler and its
  sources are installed by searching in the most common directories.
  Check the paths:
    Use the IDE menu to go to
      Environment -> Environment Options -> Files

    The 'FPC Source directory' should point to your fpc source directory. This
    directory normally ends with /fpc/ or /fpcsrc/ (e.g. /usr/share/fpcsrc or
    /home/username/freepascal/fpc) and
    contains directories like 'compiler', 'docs', 'fcl', 'rtl' and 'packages

BUGS:
	You may encouter some WARNINGS messages when launching Lazarus:
	Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate loadable module in module_path: "libsmooth.so"

	Don't worry, this is a Gnome bug (see discussion at: http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=1787). 
	To disable them, set:
	$ export GTK_PATH=
	$ export GTK_RC_FILES=
	$ lazarus
