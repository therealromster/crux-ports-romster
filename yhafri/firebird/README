PRE-INSTALL:
                * Start the preinstall script as root:
                # sh preinstall

POST-INSTALL:
		* Set the following environment variables:
		export FIREBIRD_HOME=/opt/firebird
		export PATH=$FIREBIRD_HOME/bin:$PATH

		* Start the postinstall script as root:
		# sh postinstall

WARNING:	
		* A link called "fsql" to Firebird command "isql" is created
		to avoid the confusion with the "isql" command of "unixODBC"
		if it is installed.

		* In a real-world installation, you should not put the 
		SYSDBA password in a publicly-readable file /etc/rc.d/firebird. 
		Eventually this file should not need to contain any passwords.
		As root user alone should be sufficient priviledge to stop/start 
		the server.

		* The current host where the firebird DB is installed must be a trusted host.
		The postinstall script add some entries(localhost,localhost.localdomain,`hostname`,
		"`hostname`.DomaineName") to the "/etc/hosts.equiv" file to turn the host into a trusted one.
		If you have to deal with any security issue, change this options to whatever you want.
