PRE-INSTALL:

		* Unpack Adeos patches (replace A,B,C by the current version):
		# tar xjvf xenomai-A.B.C.tar.bz2 -C /tmp/

		* Patch your kernel with the patch corresponding to
		your kernel version (replace the X in the patch name):
		# cd /usr/src/linux-`uname -r`
		# patch -p1 < /tmp/xenomai-A.B.C/arch/i386/patches/adeos-ipipe-`uname -r`-i386-X.Y-Z.patch

		* Before recompilng the kernel, make sure that
		"Power Management" option is disabled in the kernel.

INSTALL:
		* When starting the install process, a console GUI will appear.
		Select the options you want and press save and exit button (like in 
		kernel configuration GUI).
		The compile process will continue from this point.

ADVICE:	

		* For a first test, you can just keep the default values. But if you have
		an Intel processor, you may activate the SMI (System Management Interrupt) in
		the Machine(x86)/SMI workaround submenu.
