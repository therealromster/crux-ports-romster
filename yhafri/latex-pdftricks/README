INFO:
		* First method: In all the web2c TEX implementations, shell escape is turned off 
		by default. You can either turn it on by changing the line in your 
		texmf.cnf ( /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf ) to:

		shell_escape = t

		You have to recreate all the formats like pdflatex.fmt or whatever
		you might need.

		* Second method: The more elegant way will be to invoke shell escape with a switch,
		 each time you run the compiler like:

		$ pdflatex -shell-escape <file name>

POST-INSTALL:

		* To take into account the pdftricks class, you must execute 
		the command "texhash" as root:
		# texhash
