INFO:

		* I changed one behaviour of DBC to not collide with other C source parsing
		  tools. Thus, instead of writing contract like this:

                  /**
                   * pre: input != NULL
                   * post: input != NULL
                   */

		   write them like this:

		  /**!dbc
 		   * pre: input != NULL
		   * post: input != NULL
		   */

		  A lot of C source parser use start comment "/**". I changed that to "/**!dbc" which is 
		  more clear. Moreover, you can continue to use Doxygen with this new tag.
