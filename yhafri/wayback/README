POST-INSTALL:

		* Add pointer to your wayback install:
		export WAYBACK_HOME=/usr/lib/wayback

		* Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK, eg.:
		 export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/java

		* By default, the wayback.war file is configured to operate 
		in Archival URL mode. It can be installed by simply placing 
		the wayback.war file into Tomcat's webapps/ directory.

		$ export TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/lib/tomcat
		$ mv /usr/lib/wayback/webapp/wayback.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/

		If you need to run the Wayback Machine application in a 
		context path besides wayback, you will need to rename the 
		wayback.war file to CONTEXT.war before placing it in the 
		webapps/ directory. When Tomcat deploys the webapp, it will 
		be accessible via CONTEXT/. 

		$ export TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/lib/tomcat
		$ mv /usr/lib/wayback/webapp/wayback.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/CONTEXT.war

		Running the Wayback Machine in proxy mode requires the webapp 
		to run as the ROOT context, so you will need to rename wayback.war 
		to ROOT.war before placing it in the webapps/ directory. If you 
		have another ROOT webapp installed, you might want to move it out 
		of the way before putting the ROOT.war (which was originally 
		wayback.war) into place, but this is not required. If you do not 
		move the old ROOT/ (and possibly the old ROOT.war) out of the way, 
		they may be overwritten when Tomcat deploys the new ROOT webapp.

		$ export TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/lib/tomcat
		$ mv /usr/lib/wayback/webapp/wayback.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT.war
