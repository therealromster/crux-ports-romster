POST-INSTALL

Taken from klinpop README:

For this to work you must configure samba correctly (e.g. name resolution).
Add or change the line smb.conf:
message command = sh -c '_PATH_TO_/receivepopup.sh "%f" "%m" "%I" "%s"' &
(of course the real path for _PATH_TO_)

Then you should create the appropriate directory where the messages go to.
mkdir -vp -m 0777 /var/lib/klinpopup
