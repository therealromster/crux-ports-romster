POST-INSTALL
------------

After installing, make sure that the service names and port numbers listed in
the file "services.append" (which is included with this port) are added to
the file "/etc/services", if they don't already exist.  You may need to
change some existing service name/number mappings--just comment out the
existing mappings if they are wrong, and add in the new ones.

CLIENT UTILITIES
----------------

The krb5 upstream developers have several utilities/servers/man pages that are
kerberos-enabled replacements for the standard fare.  In my opinion, this is a
little brain-dead, but they have their reasons.  Here's a list of the offending
files:

  telnet
  ftp
  rcp
  rlogin
  rsh
  uuclient
  ftpd
  telnetd
  uuserver
  (all respective man pages)

This port avoids stomping on the existing utilities (which all good Crux ports
should), but still puts the kerberos-enabled versions in standard locations (to
avoid making users muck around with PATH and "man.conf" changes and refer to
either the krb5 versions of the originals by full path).

It accomplishes this by renaming the kerberos-enabled versions so that they are
prefixed by a "k"--the kerberos 'telnet' becomes 'ktelnet', and so on.  Also,
it parses the man pages and updates the utility name in each.  The utilities,
servers, and man pages are all installed to the standard "/usr/{bin,man,sbin}"
directories.  It's a hack, but I think it's the best way to do things.

I borrowed this idea from an old "unmaintained" port, but I forget who packaged
it so I cannot (unfortunately) give that person their due credit.  Apologies.

A sample "krb5.conf" file is installed, too, for your convenience.

This port also adds some framework for running a Key Distribution Center (KDC). "/var/lib/krb5kdc" is defined as the state directory, and some sample config 
files are installed therein.  The server can be started with '/etc/rc.d/kdc', 
which is also installed.
