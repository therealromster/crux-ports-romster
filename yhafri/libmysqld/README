USAGE:
		* You must link your code with libmysqld.a instead of libmysqlclient.a
		More information at:
		http://mysql.speedbone.de/doc/refman/5.0/en/libmysqld-overview.html

PRE-INSTALL:

POST-INSTALL:
		1. append /usr/lib/mysql to ld.so.conf and run ldconfig 
		2. run 'mysql_install_db' to build the system database
		   in /var/lib/mysql
		3. run 'mysql_upgrade' to add new privileges and features 
		   to the MySQL privilege tables if you have 4.x or 3.x 
		   databases
		4. Set a password for the mysql root user:
		   mysqladmin -u root password <mysql_root_password>

PRECAUTION:
		1. With the default configuration networking support for 
		   mysql is disabled, meaning the mysql daemon is accessable 
		   from localhost only. 
		   To add networking support comment out the 'skip-networking' 
		   line in /etc/my.cnf. 
		2. If you upgrade from mysql 4.0.x you must recompile the 
		   other packages on your system that are linked against the 
		   mysql client libraries (libmysqlclient). 
		   To obtain such a list of packages for your system, you 
		   may use the command 'prt-get dependent mysql' or use yapo 
		   to list the packages.

INNODB:
		  InnoDB table type support is compiled in but disabled by
		  default. Comment out the skip-innodb line in /etc/my.cnf
		  to fully enable InnoDB support.
