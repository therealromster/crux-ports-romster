IMPORTANT:

		The POST-INSTALL only needs to be run *ONCE* after installing
		the nvidia port. It is *NOT REQUIRED* when upgrading the port
		if it has been run once when the port was originally installed.



NVIDIA with UDEV:

		If using udev, add your user to the "video" group to be able to
		use the nvidia devices required for 3d to function properly.


POST-INSTALL:

		Rename /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL.so.1.2 to something else, such
		as libGL_so_1_2 and run /sbin/ldconfig. GL applications
		should then use the nvidia-installed /usr/lib/libGL.so
		instead. Rename /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libGLcore.a
		and libglx.a to something else, such as libGLcore.a.orig and
		libglx.a.orig.

		nvhelper.sh will do this for you (./nvhelper.sh --install)

		After updating or reinstalling X you have to run:
		# nvhelper.sh --install

POST-REMOVE:

		Rename /usr/X11R6/lib/libGL_so_1_2 (or whatever you called
		it) to libGL.so.1.2 and run /sbin/ldconfig. Also restore
		libglx.a and libGLcore.a in /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions.

		nvhelper.sh will do this for you (./nvhelper.sh --restore)

		To back up the original X11 3D libraries. Run:
		# nvhelper.sh --restore


CAVEATS:

		In the section extensions make sure the RENDER option is disabled
		or else you'll see the driver hang spontaniously while using
		antialiased fonts. ( Hurray for closed source drivers )

		Section "Extensions"
			#    Option "RENDER" "true"
