PRE-INSTALL:

		* To watch many of the new Quicktime trailers, you'll need to install:
		libsndfile
		lame
		id3lib
		faad2
		faac
		liba52

		* You should then recompile and upgrade mplayer, so that is built with support
		for these codecs.

		* To watch videos on sites that only support IE you need to install the
		following Firefox extension:

		http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mplayerplug-in/mplayerplug-in-0.2.1.xpi?download

		It works by converting OBJECT tags to EMBED ones.

POST-INSTALL:

		* Create a symlink to the mplayerplu-in:
		# ln -sf /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/mplayerplug-in.so /FIREFOX_INSTALL_DIR/plugins/mplayerplug-in.so
