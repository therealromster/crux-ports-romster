INSTALL:

		* AEM works only with kernel 2.6.6. You need
		to install the kernel 2.6.6 and apply the 
		patch linux-2.6.6-aem-15r10.patch to it.
		
		# cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.6
		# patch -p1 < /usr/ports/yhafri/aem/linux-2.6.6-aem-15r10.patch

		* Before compiling the kernel, make sure that kernel preemption
		was disabled:

		# make menuconfig
		Processor type and features  ---> 
		  [ ] Preemptible Kernel 

		# make all
		# make modules_install
		# lilo
		# reboot

		* After that, install the "aem" port like any other:
		# pkgmk -d -i
