PRE-INSTALL

Add kernel support for inotify, Extended Attributes for the filesystem
that you want to index.

Add "user_xattr" to the mount options of the filesystem you would
like to index.  Here is my /etc/fstab:

/dev/hdb3   /home       reiserfs    notail,noatime,user_xattr 2 2

Extended Atrributes are absolutely mandatory.

Now reboot.
