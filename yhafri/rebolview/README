POST-INSTALL:

IMPORTANT:
1) This is the part view of Rebol or REBOL/VIEW.
After installing, Rebol view is called "rebolv". This makes us able to distinguish between rebol (REBOL/CORE) and rebolv (REBOL/VIEW)


2) To enable the "rebol-mode" for emacs, add the following lines to your .emacs (or .emacs.el) file in your home directory:

---START--------------------copy and past this---------------START---

(defun go-rebol ()
  (interactive)
  (progn
	(save-buffer)
        (switch-to-buffer
        (process-buffer
        	(setq proc
                (start-process "subrebol" "subrebol" "/usr/bin/rebol" "-qwsl"
                	(buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))))
        (comint-mode)
  )
)
(global-set-key "\M-e" (quote go-rebol))

(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp") load-path))
(load-library "rebol.el") 
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.r" . rebol-mode))
