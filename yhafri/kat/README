Configuration
===============================================================================

Inotify is a file notification system for the Linux kernel. As of 2.6.13-rc3,
it is included in the stable Linux kernel series. You can learn more about
inotify here: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/inotify/. 
The Kat deamon does not require inotify, but it is strongly recommended as it
will greatly improve your Kat search experience. Without it, Kat will not
automatically detect all changes to your home directory and index the data in a
timely fashion.

Only versions of Inotify >=0.24 will work with all versions of Kat.  Because 
Inotify is in Linus' kernel, the interface will be stable as of the release of
the 2.6.13 kernel. All future versions of Kat above 0.6 will use this 
interface.

If you must use an older kernel, then you need this patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/inotify/v2.6/0.24/inotify-0.24-rml-2.6.13-rc2-4.patch

Make sure you enable (set to 'y') the option "Inotify file change notification
support (INOTIFY)" under Device Drivers / Character Devices. This is the
CONFIG_INOTIFY option. 
It can also be found in File Systems if you use make menuconfig. Also ensure 
extended attributes are enabled for your chosen filesystem(s). e.g. 
EXT2_FS_XATTR, EXT3_FS_XATTR, REISERFS_FS_XATTR and so on.

Jaeger recommends mounting POSIX shared memory in his Beagle README.  This can be accomplished by verifying that the following line is in your /etc/fstab:

none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0

Now rebuild your kernel, and reboot!
