PRE-INSTALL:

		* Linux/x86 requires that the kernel be patched and 
		recompiled with the PerfCtr patch. 
		The required patches and complete installation instructions 
		are provided in the papi-$version/src/perfctr-x.y 
		directory.

		If your kernel is OK, you can modify and execute the 
		bash script "papi-kernel-patch.sh".

		* For full install documentation refer to INSTALL.txt
				

POST-INSTALL:

		* The kernel-side of this package is implemented as a 
		character device driver, which has been assigned major 
		number 10 and minor number 182.
		The first time you install the package, a special file 
		representing this device must be created. As root, 
		execute:

        	mknod /dev/perfctr c 10 182
        	chmod 644 /dev/perfctr

		If the driver was built as a module, it will be have to 
		be loaded into the kernel before it can be used. This 
		will happen automatically if the kernel was built with 
		support for the kernel module loader (CONFIG_KMOD=y). 
		For 2.6 kernels no further action is needed. For
		2.4 kernels, the following should be added to 
		/etc/modules.conf:

        	alias char-major-10-182 perfctr
