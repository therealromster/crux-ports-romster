HOW TO INSTALL PAPI ONTO YOUR SYSTEM
*****************************************************************************

On some of the systems that PAPI supports, you can install PAPI right 
out of the box without any additional setup. Others require drivers or 
patches to be installed first.

The general installation steps are below, but first find your particular 
Operating System's section for any additional steps that may be necessary.
NOTE: the configure and make files are located in the papi/src directory.

General Installation

1.	% ./configure
	% make

2.	Check for errors. 

	a) Run a simple test case: (This will run ctests/zero)

	% make test

	If you get good counts, you can optionally run all the test programs
	with the included test harness. This will run the tests in quiet mode, 
	which will print PASSED, FAILED, or SKIPPED. Tests are SKIPPED if the
	functionality being tested is not supported by that platform.

	% make fulltest (This will run ./run_tests.sh)

	To run the tests in verbose mode:

	% ./run_tests.sh -v

3.	Create a PAPI binary distribution or install PAPI directly.

	a) To install PAPI libraries and header files from the build tree:

	% make install

	b) To install PAPI manual pages from the build tree:

	% make install-man

	c) To install PAPI test programs from the build tree:

	% make install-tests

	d) To install all of the above in one step from the build tree:

	% make install-all

	e) To create a binary kit, papi-<arch>.tgz:

	% make dist

*****************************************************************************
MORE ABOUT CONFIGURE OPTIONS
*****************************************************************************

Beginning with PAPI 3.5.0, there is an extensive array of options available
from the configure command-line. These options select default directories,
32- or 64-bit library modes, driver versions, compiler settings and more.
For complete details on the command-line options:
	% ./configure --help

*****************************************************************************
Operating System Specific Installation Steps (In Alphabetical Order by OS)
*****************************************************************************

AIX - IBM POWER3, POWER4, POWER5
*****************************************************************************
PAPI is supported on AIX 5.x for POWER3, POWER4 and POWER5.
Use ./configure to select the desired make options for your system, 
specifying the --with_bitmode=32 or --with-bitmode=64 to select wordlength.
32 bits is the default.

1.	On AIX 5.x, the bos.pmapi is a product level fileset (part of the OS).
	However, it is not installed by default. Consult your sysadmin to 
	make sure it is installed. 
2.	Follow the general instructions for installing PAPI.

WARNING: PAPI requires XLC version 6 or greater.
Your version can be determined by running 'lslpp -a -l | grep -i xlc'.

BG/L 
*****************************************************************************
BG/L is a cross-compiled environment. The machine on which PAPI is compiled
is not the machine on which PAPI runs. To compile PAPI on BG/L, specify the 
BG/L environment as shown below:

	% ./configure --with-OS=bgl
	% make

The testing targets in the make file will not work in the BG/L environment.
Since BG/L supports multiple queueing systems, you must manually execute
programs in the ctests and ftests directories to check for successful
library creation. You can also manually edit the run_tests.sh script to
automate testing for your installation. 

WARNING: ./configure might fail if the cross compiler is not in your path.
	 In that is the case, just add it to your path 
	 and everything should work.

Catamount - Cray XT3 Opteron
*****************************************************************************
The Cray XT3 is also a cross-compiled environment. In this case, configure
can automatically detect that fact and make appropriate default assignments.
Please note that although Catamount contains the necessary PerfCtr patches
to access the hardware counters, a customzed copy of the Perfctr 2.5.4 source
is necessary to compile and link PAPI. Contact Cray for a copy of these sources.

The testing targets in the make file will not work in the Catamount 
environment. It is necessary to log into an interactive session and run the 
tests manually through the job submission system. For example, instead of:
	% make test
use:
	% yod -sz 1 ctests/zero
and instead of:
	% make fulltest
use:
	% ./run_cat_tests.sh

PLATFORM NOTES:
PAPI on Catamount currently supports single event overflow. It does not 
support multiple event overflow or profiling. Many of the overflow and
profile tests in the PAPI distribution WILL SEGFAULT in this release.

Linux - Itanium I & II
*****************************************************************************
PAPI on Itanium Linux links to the perfmon library. The library version and 
the Itanium version are automatically determined by configure.
If you wish to override the defaults, a number of pfm options are available
to configure. Use:
	% ./configure --help
to learn more about these options.

Follow the general installation instructions to complete your installation.

PLATFORM NOTES:
The earprofile test fails under perfmon for Itanium I and II. It has been
reconfigured to work on the upcoming perfmon2 interface.

Linux - Itanium Montecito
*****************************************************************************
A preliminary implementation of PAPI for Montecito is available in this
release. It can be configured using either libpfm or the beta perfmon2
implementation. Your operating system will require a kernel patch to use
perfmon2. Contact the PAPI team if you are interested in experimenting
with this implementation. CAVEAT EMPTOR.

Linux - PPC64 (POWER5, POWER4, and PowerPC970)
****************************************************************************
Linux/PPC64 requires that the kernel be patched and recompiled with the
PerfCtr patch.   The required patches and complete installation instructions
are provided in the papi/src/perfctr-2.7.x directory. PPC64 is the ONLY 
platform that REQUIRES use of PerfCtr 2.7.x.

*- IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PATCHED YOUR KERNEL AND/OR INSTALLED PERFCTR -*

WARNING: You should always use a PerfCtr distribution that has been distributed
with a version of PAPI or your build will fail. The reason for this is that
PAPI builds a shared library of the Perfctr runtime, on which libpapi.so
depends. PAPI also depends on the .a file, which it decomposes into component
objects files and includes in the libpapi.a file for convenience. If you
install a new perfctr, even a shared library, YOU MUST REBUILD PAPI to get
a proper, working libpapi.a.

There are several options in configure to allow you to specify your perfctr 
version and location. Use:
	% ./configure --help
to learn more about these options.

Follow the general installation instructions to complete your installation.

Linux/x86 - Intel Pentium, Core and AMD Athlon, Opteron
*****************************************************************************
Linux/x86 requires that the kernel be patched and recompiled with the PerfCtr
patch. The required patches and complete installation instructions are 
provided in the papi/src/perfctr-x.y directory. Please see the INSTALL file
in that directory.

Do not forget, you also need to build your kernel with APIC support in order
for hardware overflow to work. This is very important for accurate statistical
profiling ala gprof via the hardware counters.

So, when you configure your kernel to build with PERFCTR as above, make
sure you turn on APIC support in the "Processor type and features" section.
This should be enabled by default if you are on an SMP, but it is disabled
by default on a UP. 

In our 2.4.x kernels:
> grep PIC /usr/src/linux/.config
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
/usr/src/linux/.config:CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y

You can verify the APIC is working after rebooting with the new kernel
by running the 'perfex -i' command found in the perfctr/examples/perfex
directory.

PAPI on x86 assumes PerfCtr 2.6.x. You can change this with the 
'--with-perfctr=<5,6,7> option to ./configure. THIS IS NOT ADVISED.
PerfCtr version 2.5.4 is specific for Cray XT3, and PerfCtr 2.7.x is
supported only for PPC64.
NOTE: THE VERSIONS OF PERFCTR DO NOT CORRESPOND TO LINUX KERNEL VERSIONS.

*- IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PATCHED YOUR KERNEL AND/OR INSTALLED PERFCTR -*

WARNING: You should always use a PerfCtr distribution that has been distributed
with a version of PAPI or your build may fail. Newer versions with backward
compatibility may also work. PAPI builds a shared library of the Perfctr 
runtime, on which libpapi.so depends. PAPI also depends on the .a file, 
which it decomposes into component objects files and includes in the libpapi.a 
file for convenience. If you install a new PerfCtr, even a shared library, 
YOU MUST REBUILD PAPI to get a proper, working libpapi.a. 

There are several options in configure to allow you to specify your perfctr 
version and location. Use:
	% ./configure --help
to learn more about these options.

Follow the general installation instructions to complete your installation.

PLATFORM NOTES:
Opteron fails the matrix-hl test because the default definition of PAPI_FP_OPS
overcounts speculative floating point operations.

MIPS - IRIX 6.5
*****************************************************************************
No additional steps are required to install PAPI on IRIX. Follow the 
general installation guide, and everything should work.


Solaris 8 - Ultrasparc
*****************************************************************************
The only requirement for Solaris is that you must be running version 2.8 or 
newer.  As long as that requirement is met, no additional steps are required 
to install PAPI and you can follow the general installation guide.

Unicos - Cray X1
*****************************************************************************
No additional steps are required to get PAPI working on Unicos.
Follow the general installation guide, and everything should work.

PLATFORM NOTES:
Cray X1 currently fails on ctests/overflow_force_software.


Windows XP/2000/Server 2003 - Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon / Opteron
*****************************************************************************
PAPI 3.5 for Windows runs on Pentium III, Athlon and Opteron, for 
Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

Earlier versions of PAPI for Windows provided a self-installing executable.
That is not the case with the current release.

The Windows source tree comes with Microsoft Visual Studio Version 8 projects
to build a graphical shell application, the PAPI library as a DLL, a kernel 
driver to provide access to the counters, and a collection of C test programs.

The WinPMC driver must be installed with administrator privileges. See the 
winpmc.html file in the papi/win2k/winpmc directory for details on building 
and installing this driver.

The general installation instructions are irrelevant for Windows.
