INSTALL:
		* During the install process, you'll be prompted to enter your login name.

POST-INSTALL:

		* Change the line in "/etc/inittab" file:
		c1:2:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 vc/1 linux

		to:

		c1:2:respawn:/sbin/agetty -n -l /usr/sbin/autologin 38400 vc/1 linux		

		* If your login shell is "/bin/bash", add the following line to your "~/.bashrc" 
		(or "~/.bash_profile"):

		if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ] && [ $(tty) == /dev/tty1 ]; then
  		  startx
		fi

		Otherwise, if your login shell is "/bin/sh", add the above code to your "~/.profile".
		tcsh users need to convert the above to the equivalent csh script.

		* If there is already a GUI desktop running (via xdm, gdm or kdm, etc) then invoke 
		startx -- :1   instead

		* Optional:
		You can go further by making use of the "~/.xinitrc" file to initiate particular desktop 
		applications.
