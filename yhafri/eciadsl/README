PRE-INSTALL:
		* If your kernel is 2.6.0 or 2.6.6 it must be
		pached before installing this port. 
		For more details, read the document at:
		http://eciadsl.flashtux.org/download/beta/Readme.txt
		Recompile your kernel with the options described at: 
		http://eciadsl.flashtux.org/faq.php?lang=en#5.3
		For other kernels, jump this step.


POST-INSTALL:
		* Configure your connection in text mode with
		"/usr/bin/eciadsl-config-text" or by a Tk GUI using 
		"/usr/bin/eciadsl-config-tk".

		* After that, don't forget to protect the below files
		from reading. As root type:
		# chmod 600 /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
		# chmod 600 /etc/ppp/pap-secrets

		* See my example files to connect to the "club-internet"
		provider:
		/etc/ppp/{chap-secrets,pap-secrets}
		/etc/eciadsl/eciadsl.conf

		* If you want to use the "startmodem.exp" script which 
		automate the pppd connection even if it fails, you 
		must also install the "expect" port.
	
INFO:
		* This ports is available with httpup. See:
