POST-INSTALL:

		* first of all, create users dnscache and dnslog:
		# useradd dnscache
		# useradd dnslog

		* tell dnscache to listen to address 192.168.1.3 to servers DNS requests
		(change it to what you want depending on your config). 
		# dnscache-conf dnscache dnslog /var/dnscache 192.168.1.3
		
		* tell dnscache about your primary DNS server name of your ISP.
		In my case, 194.117.200.15 for club-internet (my internet provider):
		# echo 194.117.200.15 > /var/dnscache/root/servers/@

		* turn on the forward:
		# echo 1 > /var/dnscache/env/FORWARDONLY

		* let dnscache accepts all requests from your local network:
		# touch /var/dnscache/root/ip/192.168.1

		* change your resolve.conf to use your local DNS cache :
		# echo "nameserver 192.168.1.3" > /etc.resolv.conf 
		
		* test the beast:
		# /etc/rc.d/dnscache start
		# host www.nerim.net 192.168.1.13 (slow the first time, but dnscache store it in the cache)
		# host www.nerim.net 192.168.1.13 (very fast after that because retrieved from cache)
		# ...
		# dnsip www.yahoo.com
		# dnsname `dnsip www.yahoo.com`

		* you can activate this service permanently by adding dnscache to your /etc/rc.conf
		Enjoy
