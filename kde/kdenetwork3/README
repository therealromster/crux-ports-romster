POST-INSTALL

/etc/rc.d/lisa starts LISa, the LAN Information Server.

LISa is intended to provide a kind of "network neighbourhood", although
it only relies on the TCP/IP protocol stack--no SMB or whatever.

You'll need to run kcontrol -> Internet & Network -> Local Network
Browsing.  /etc/rc.d/lisa start, and network browsing is go!

Included in this directory is a sample /etc/lisa.conf, in case you
need one.
