	After observing that my music was often skipping, I noticed 
	that /usr/bin/artswrapper isn't setuid.

PRECAUTION

	Although artswrapper exists to execute artsd with real-time privileges for
	a normal user, setuid still makes me apprehensive.  For this reason, I
	restrict the group of users which can use artswrapper.

	# chgrp wheel /usr/bin/artswrapper
	# chmod 750   /usr/bin/artswrapper
	# chmod u+s   /usr/bin/artswrapper
