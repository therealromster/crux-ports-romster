Don't forget to chown the /var/cache/mpdscribble/*.journal to the user you want
to run mpdscribble as, it needs to be writable for this user, otherwise played
songs can't be cached if no internet connection is present (mpdscribble does
this to scrobble played tracks later if a connection to the scrobbler server
could not be established)

You might also want to add a rule similiar to the following to
/etc/pkgadd.conf, to protect the cache from accidentally being overwritten by
upgrades.

-- snip --
UPGRADE		^var/cache/mpdscribble/.*\.journal$	NO
