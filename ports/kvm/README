README for kvm

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
	Remove old kvm kernel modules:
	# rm /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/{kvm,kvm-intel,kvm-amd}.ko

POST-INSTALL
	Update modules dependencies:
		# /sbin/depmod -a

RESOURCES

PRECAUTION
	This port installs a symbolic link to kvm binary as /usr/bin/qemu.
	This would give a file conflict with (at least) opt/qemu-bin.
