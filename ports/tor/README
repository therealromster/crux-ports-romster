README for tor

PRECAUTION
    Make sure you edit /etc/pkgadd.conf and add the following line.

    UPGRADE         ^var/lib/tor/.*$    NO
    UPGRADE         ^etc/tor/torrc$     NO

    Failure to do so will result in the loss of your tor data and
    configuration upon update!

    If you edit the torrc file for extra logging, make sure you:
    chmod 0640 /var/log/tor/* files, for security reasons.

PRE-INSTALL
    Tor expects to have a user and group dedicated to it, a
    pre-install script has been added to the port which takes
    care of this.

NOTES
    Please edit /etc/tor/torrc and add "tor" to the SERVICES
    array in /etc/rc.conf
