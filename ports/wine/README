README for wine 0.9.1+


REQUIREMENTS


PRE-INSTALL


POST-INSTALL

The command 'winecfg' is now used to alter your configuration 
settings. If you still have a config file the settings will be
moved into the registry (acessed by 'regedit') and the config 
file will not be parsed anymore.


PRECAUTION

If you are having any problems, it is highly recommmended that 
you clean out your WINEPREFIX directory (eg: /home/user/.wine/) 
as old configuration data can cause problems.
