Extract the Starcraft data from the original CD.

	startool /path/to/starcraft_cd data.sg

Copy over the scripts and the fog.png file.

	cp -r scripts data.sg
	cp contrib/fog.png data.sg/graphics/tilesets

After you have done this, Stargus is ready to play. Read the features page to see what currently does and doesn't work.

	cd stratagus-version
	./stratagus -d ../stargus/data.sg
