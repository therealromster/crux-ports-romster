POST-INSTALL

Use opt/gl-select from ports to select the correct gl/glx
libraries and extensions like so:

        # gl-select use ati

Also to configure your X server you can execute ati configurator like so:

	# aticonfig --initial --input=/etc/X11/xorg.conf

And if you want, you can start the ati external events daemon at
/etc/rc.d/atieventsd, like so:

  	# service atieventsd start


POST-REMOVE

Use opt/gl-select from ports to revert to the xorg gl/glx libraries
and extensions like so:

        # gl-select use xorg 


When UPGRADING/DOWNGRADING the ati-driver port (where the version changes),
use gl-select to revert to xorg and then re-select ati in order to
refresh the libGLcore and libGL symlinks, like so:

        # prt-get update ati
        # gl-select use xorg; gl-select use ati
